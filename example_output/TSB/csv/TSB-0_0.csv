2,(c) Impairment of financial assets (continued) 
3,"Purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) Financial assets that are credit impaired at the date of their purchase or origination will be reported in a separate POCI category. For such assets, lifetime ECL are incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate on initial recognition. Consequently, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance on initial recognition. The amount recognised as a loss subsequent to initial recognition is equal to the change in lifetime ECL since initial recognition of the asset. Subsequent to origination, POCI financial assets that no longer meet the stage 3 criteria will no longer be considered to be credit impaired but will continue to be reported as POCI. "
4,"Write offs A loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery (as a result of the customer's insolvency, ceasing to trade or other reason) and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the statement of comprehensive income. Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with TSB's procedures for recovery of amounts due. In the event of significant improvements in expected recoveries on stage 3 assets, impairment reversals are recognised as a credit to impairment losses in the income statement. "
5,"Modified financial assets and derecognition A financial asset that is renegotiated is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement made on substantially different terms. Where the contractual cash flows of a financial asset have been modified and the financial asset was not derecognised, its gross carrying amount is recalculated as the present value of the modified contractual cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate with a gain or loss recognised in the income statement. The contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, primarily due to customers being granted a concession due to their financial difficulty and the loan being considered in forbearance. "
6,"Methodology for measuring expected credit losses The allowance for ECLs is calculated using three main components: a probability of default (PD), a loss given default (LGD); and the exposure at default (EAD). For accounting purposes, the 12 month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of a default occurring over the next 12 months or the lifetime of the financial instruments, respectively, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date and expected future economic conditions that affect credit risk. "
7,"The LGD represents losses expected on default, taking into account the mitigating effect of collateral, its expected value when realised and the time value of money and is discounted using the effective interest rate. The EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdown of a committed facility. "
8,"ECL is calculated by multiplying the PD (12 month or lifetime depending on the staging of the loan), LGD and EAD. In respect of TSB's mortgages and unsecured personal loans, ECL is calculated from the initial recognition of the loan for the maximum period that TSB is exposed to credit risk which takes into account expected customer repayment behaviour. In respect of revolving loans, such as overdrafts and credit cards, TSB's exposure to credit risk is not limited to the contractual period and the expected life is calculated based on the estimated behavioural life of the loan and associated undrawn facility which is currently ten years. The measurement of ECL also takes into account all reasonable and supportable information, including forward looking economic scenarios to calculate a probability weighted forward looking estimate. "
9,(d) Derecognition of financial assets Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when TSB has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either (i) substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred; or (ii) TSB has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards but has transferred control. 
10,"Where TSB enters into securitisation transactions to finance certain loans and advances to customers using a structured entity funded by the issue of debt, these loans and advances continue to be recognised, as TSB has not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards. A corresponding liability for the funding is also recognised. "
11,"Financial instruments sold under a repurchase agreement, under which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by TSB, continue to be recognised on the balance sheet and the sale proceeds are recognised as a financial liability. The difference between the sale and repurchase price is recognised over the life of the agreement as interest "
