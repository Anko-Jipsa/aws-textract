1,"Forecast economic scenarios (continued) The four scenarios, together with the weightings applied at December 2020, are described below. By necessity, these scenarios have been updated significantly from the scenarios used in 2019 to reflect the impact in 2020 of COVID-19. At the date of this report, GDP was expected to have decreased by 11.5% in 2020 while house prices remained buoyant and unemployment stable, reflecting support from the government through measures such as the various job protection schemes and relaxations to stamp duty on house purchases. Throughout 2020, the potential outcomes from the UK:EU trade agreement negotiations were monitored and reflected in the suite of economic scenarios used throughout the year. Subsequent to the agreement reached in December, scenarios that considered the specific risks of 'no deal' Brexit were removed. "
2,"Base case scenario: Cautious recovery following the COVID-19 economic ""shock' in 2020 Following a significant fall in 2020, a recovery in GDP commences from early 2021 with a return to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022. Employment levels continue to be maintained by government support schemes, with unemployment forecast to peak in the second quarter of 2021 at 7.3%. Forecast house prices are expected to suffer a peak to trough fall of 12% by the second half of 2021 reflecting the anticipated increase in unemployment and the end of the current temporary concession in stamp duty. "
3,"Downside scenario: Recovery stalls in the first half of 2021 GDP begins to recover in H1 2021, but at a slower rate than the base case scenario, as restrictions remain in place. Certain sectors, such as hospitality and leisure, are particularly damaged. Unemployment rises sharply, peaking at 8.7% in the second quarter of 2021 due to weak recovery and the ending of the Government's support schemes. Unemployment eventually begins to fall but remains higher than the base case due to long-term scarring effects. In response, the BoE cuts Bank Rate to zero. House prices suffer a peak to trough fall of 15% in this scenario. "
